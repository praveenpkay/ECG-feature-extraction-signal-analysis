This file is an extention of the project to a python GUI.
You need to download matlab engine and install to use the APIs.
This script.py file will run calling the matlab functions. 

Once matlab engine is installed, after running the script.py file, 
two windows will open, one for entering a text file name, 
and one more to perfom signal analysis.

Enter the text file name as 't1_30sec_19200.txt' 
and minimise the window, and hence 
signal analysis can be performed.
