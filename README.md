# ECG-feature-extraction-signal-analysis
This is subset of a project on Predicting heart disease using single lead ECG sensor,
Here in this repository, the focus is mainly on signal analysis and feature extraction.

This Capstone Project is divided into two parts.
1. PQRST detection & ECG text files.
- Used MATLAB to extract PQRST data paints from ECG signal.
- ECG Signal captured through Single lead ECG sensor. 
2. Front end With Python GUI
- Made a GUI interface to perform Initial Diagnosis of the patient. 
- Python APIs connects to MATLAB and brings up the necessary signal plots.
